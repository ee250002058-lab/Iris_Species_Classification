# Iris Dataset Classification

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species using the classic Iris dataset.
 
## Dataset
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples with four numerical features:
- Sepal Length(cm)
- Sepal Width(cm)
- Petal Length(cm)
- Petal Width(cm)

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Supervised multi-class classification
- Neural network with Softmax output
- Categorical Cross-Entropy loss

## Results
- The Model achieved 100% accuracy.
- Petal width was the primary identifier.
- Confusion matrix used for evaluation

- `report.pdf` – Detailed project report
- `dataset/` – Dataset files

## Future Improvements
- Cross-validation
- Comparison with SVM, KNN, Decision Trees
- Deployment as a web application
